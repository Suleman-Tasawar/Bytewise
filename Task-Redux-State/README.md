# Global State Managment with React/Redux

Tried a better and efficient way to perform state managment without passing props to components who actually needed it.I had also tried managing state with props but it always gives me headaches when deciding that how should i get this state to that component then **React Context** saved me from all that props passing.But i then realized that react context is better for passing small data like theme or auth status

I leanrt the follwing things from Redux

1. Creating a redux store with a reducer function for holding all states
2. A Slice to manage each compoent state seperatly
